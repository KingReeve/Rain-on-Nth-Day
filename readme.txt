The probability that it will rain tomorrow is dependent on whether or not it is raining today and whether or not it rained yesterday.

If it rained yesterday and today, there is a 20% chance it will rain tomorrow. If it rained one of the days, there is a 60% chance it will rain tomorrow. If it rained neither today nor yesterday, there is a 20% chance it will rain tomorrow.

Given that it is raining today and that it rained yesterday, write a function rain_days to give the probability that it will rain on the nth day after today.

I bet there's some fancy markov transition matrix shenanigans you can do to solve it as well. Yeah it's not calculating the probability, but this was accepted as the solution. I'm not a hundred percent sure on the wording that would make this the right answer.
